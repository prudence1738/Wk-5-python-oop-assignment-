# Python OOP Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a Python assignment demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including **classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**. The assignment includes two activities:

1. **Smartphone Class** – Designing a class with inheritance and encapsulation.  
2. **Vehicle Polymorphism** – Demonstrating polymorphism using different vehicle types.

---

## Activity 1: Smartphone Class
- **File:** `smartphone.py`
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Classes and constructors (`__init__`)
  - Attributes and methods
  - Encapsulation (private attributes)
  - Inheritance (Smartwatch inherits from Smartphone)
  - Polymorphism (overriding methods in the child class)


---

## Activity 2: Vehicle Polymorphism
- **File:** `vehicles.py`
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Base and child classes
  - Polymorphism (same method name, different behavior)
  - Inheritance
